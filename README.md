# String Converter: A User's Guide
Thank you for your interest in the String Transformer application. This Python-based utility provides a straightforward solution for manipulating text strings, including converting to uppercase, applying alternating case formats, and exporting characters to a CSV file. This guide will walk you through the application's functionality, setup instructions, and usage.

## Key Features
Uppercase Conversion: Transform any text to uppercase for emphasis or stylistic purposes.
Alternating Case: Create a playful variation of text with alternating uppercase and lowercase characters.
CSV Export: Export the individual characters of your text to a CSV file for further analysis or use.

## Installation and Setup
### Prerequisites
Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. If not, please download and install it from python.org.

## Getting Started
Clone the application repository to your local machine by executing the following command in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/string-converter.git
cd string-transformer-app
```

This application does not require additional Python packages outside of the standard library.

### Running the Application
To start the application, navigate to the project directory and run:

```
string_converter.py
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to input your text. The application will display the transformed strings and generate a CSV file in the current directory, indicating its path upon completion.

## How It Works
The application comprises three main components:

- StringTransformer: Handles text transformations, including converting to uppercase and applying alternating cases.
- CSVWriter: Manages the generation of CSV files from the input text.
- Application: Orchestrates user input, text transformation, and CSV file generation.
